# Pong

Created Spring 2022<br>
This is a Pong game with two players. The ball will speed up after making contact with the paddles. Player 0 (left side/blue) will use the "W" key and "S" key, and player 1 (right side/red) will use the "up" and "down" arrow keys to move the paddle up and down.

## Prerequisites

## Executing Program

Download the code to your local device. Then, run the "PongGame.class" file to open the game. 

## Inspiration

I wanted to create a game from scratch using Java GUI, and the reason why I chose pong is because this game used to be my favorite childhood computer game. 

## Future Development

Adding one-player game mode(player vs. computer), more adjustable and customizable features(paddle size, ball size, colors, etc.), cross-device game(Online PVP)
